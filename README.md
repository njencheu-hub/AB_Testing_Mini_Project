## Overview

This analysis compared two digital marketing campaigns using an A/B testing framework to evaluate performance across the full purchase funnel. Data preprocessing included text parsing, type conversion, and missing value handling to ensure clean metrics.

---

## üåç Real-World Use Cases

- **Digital Marketing Teams**: Optimize campaign strategy by identifying underperforming funnel stages.
- **Product Teams**: Understand how changes to ad content or landing pages influence user engagement.
- **Growth Analysts**: Validate campaign effectiveness before full rollout.
- **E-commerce Teams**: Identify which campaigns lead to more purchases and better ROI.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- Cleans and preps funnel data from both control and test campaigns
- Calculates engagement and conversion metrics for each funnel stage
- Applies Z-tests for statistical comparison of purchase conversion rates
- Optional configurations for testing direction (`two-sided`, `smaller`)
- Generates summary statistics for visualization and reporting

---

## Key Funnel Metrics Analyzed

This project computes and compares the following key performance indicators (KPIs) across control and test groups:

- **CTR (Click-Through Rate)**
- **Search Rate**
- **View Content Rate**
- **Add to Cart Rate**
- **Purchase Rate**
- **Overall Conversion Rate**

Each stage was computed and averaged across both groups to diagnose drop-off points and performance differences.

---

## Statistical Test Results

A **Z-test** was conducted on the purchase conversion rates:

- **Z-statistic:** 33.77  
- **P-value:** 2.3e-250 ‚Üí Statistically significant  
- **Results**: The **Test campaign outperformed** the Control campaign with overwhelming confidence.

**Optional tests explored:**
- Alternative hypotheses (`two-sided`, `smaller`)
- Confidence intervals
- Custom funnel metrics (CTR, Add-to-Cart, etc.)

---

## Conclusion

The test campaign demonstrated a significant uplift in purchases versus the control. This result supports a full rollout of the new marketing approach. Funnel-based analysis highlighted which stages drove this improvement, enabling further targeted optimizations.
